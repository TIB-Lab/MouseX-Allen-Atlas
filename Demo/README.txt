## DEMO DATA

MouseX DW-ALLEN Annotation can easily be used to parcellate you own experimental data by using ANTs:

  1) Skull removal is needed for the registration, check our in house automated brain extraction tool for rodents: SAMson
          Read the preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.07.583982)
          Acces the GitHub for SAMson [here](https://github.com/CanalsLab/SAMson)
  2) Follow the steps on demo.m, or run ANTs from the terminal
  3) You can find demo data for three subjects, including the FA maps, the outputs of the registration, and the MouseX-Annotation
