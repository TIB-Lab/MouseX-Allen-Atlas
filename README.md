Sex matters: the MouseX DW-ALLEN Atlas and Parcellation for mice diffusion-weighted MR imaging

Overcoming sex bias in preclinical research needs not only including animals of both sexes, but also developing proper tools to handle such data. This repositorie provides a novel dw-MRI parcellation created with the publically available Allen Brain Atlas, and including both sexes: the MouseX DW ALLEN Atlas. Together with the atlas, we provide a high resolution template with three contrasts: relaxometry T2W, and diffusion-based FA and MD contrasts. For the FA contrast, we provide templates created with 1) both sexes, 2)one with only male subjects, and 3)one with  only female.
