##Sex matters: the MouseX DW-ALLEN Atlas for mice diffusion-weighted MR imaging

Overcoming sex bias in preclinical research needs not only including animals of both sexes, but also developing proper tools to handle such data. This repositorie provides a novel DW-MRI mouse brain template and annotation created with the publically available Allen Brain Atlas, and including both sexes: the MouseX DW-ALLEN Atlas. Here we first provide a high resolution template with three contrasts: relaxometry T2W, and diffusion-based FA and MD contrasts. For the FA contrast, we provide templates created with 1) both sexes, 2)one with only male subjects, and 3)one with  only female. Then, we provide the MouseX DW-ALLEN annotation corresponding to Allen Mouse Brain Atlas region organziation, and the corresponding Labels document with region-number assignation.
