# MouseX-DW-Allen-Atlas
## Sex matters: the MouseX DW-ALLEN Atlas for mice diffusion-weighted MR imaging

_NOTE: new updated version of the Annotations are available from February 2024 on, if you had previously downloaded the files, we welcome you to replace them by the new version_

Overcoming sex bias in preclinical research needs not only including animals of both sexes, but also developing proper tools to handle such data. This repository provides a novel DW-MRI mouse brain template and annotation created with the publically available Allen Brain Atlas, and including both sexes: the **MouseX DW-ALLEN Atlas**.

## TEMPLATES: 
Here we first provide a high resolution template with three contrasts: **relaxometry T2W**, and **diffusion-based FA and MD contrasts**.

For the T2W contrast, we provide templates created with
  1) both sexes: find it in folder MouseX [MouseX](MouseX)
  2) one with only male subjects: find it in folder MouseX_male-only [MouseX_male-only](MouseX_female-only)
  3) one with only female: find it in folder MouseX_female-only [MouseX_female-only](MouseX_female-only)

## ANNOTATIONS:
Then, we provide the **MouseX DW-ALLEN** annotation corresponding to **Allen Mouse Brain Atlas** region organziation, and the corresponding Labels document with region-number assignation, with a total of 62 regions, for each of the three templates (both sexes, male only and female only).

### TWO-HEMISPHERE ANNOTATION:
For those experimenters needing to differentate each hemisphere, we provide the "MouseX-DW-ALLEN_AnnotationL-R", where We have maintained the right side with the original value, and the left side is now original value + 100.

Find it in folder [MouseX](MouseX)
